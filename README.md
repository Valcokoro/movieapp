# A Movie App

This App was created using the create-react-app, integrating a movies database API from rapid api. Ideally, it shows a list of movies generated according to 
a movie name searched using the search bar. But due to an issue encountred while trying to subscribe to the basic version of the API, which made me 
unable to subscribe, the movies will not show as expected, but the App will work as expected once the API issue is sorted out. 

## How to use the App
When you start the App initially, it brings up a default movie "Avengers: Endgame", then you can use the search bar to search for any other movie of your choice,
which will generate a number movies of movies that match the title you searched. Then you can click on any of the movies to view the details of that particular movie.

In the project directory, you can run:

### Things to Note
Please note that there was an issue subscribing to the API, even the basic version, and this gave rise to cloning the API in some aspect of the App.
However, if this issue is sorted out, the App will work as expected. I sent a mail to RapidApi regarding the issue, but haven't gotten any response from them.
